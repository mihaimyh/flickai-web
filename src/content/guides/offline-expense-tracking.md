# Offline expense tracking (checklist)

Track spending reliably without internet.

Offline tracking is about reliability: capture receipts and expenses immediately, even with no signal, then sync when you’re ready.

## Checklist

- Make sure capture works without an internet connection
- Standardize categories (travel, meals, supplies, mileage)
- Review totals weekly to catch mistakes early
- Export backups for your accountant or records

## FAQ

**Why does offline mode matter?**
It prevents lost receipts and missing entries when you’re traveling or have poor connectivity.

**Is offline tracking private?**
It can be — offline-first workflows reduce unnecessary data sharing and give you more control.

**When should I sync?**
Sync when it’s convenient and secure for you — for example, on trusted Wi‑Fi.
