# FlickAI SEO Implementation Summary (Dec 2025)

## Overview
This repo implements a static, multi-locale marketing site for FlickAI with strong technical SEO foundations (canonicals, hreflang, sitemap alternates, structured data) plus a hub-and-spoke content model (Features + Alternatives + Integrations + Guides).

This document has two parts:
1) What’s already shipped in code.
2) The operational playbook (GSC + indexing + backlinks) that turns “done code” into rankings.

## What’s shipped (in this repo)

### International SEO (10 locales)
- Locales: `en` (root) plus `ar`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `ro`, `zh`, `id`, `hi`, `it` under `/{locale}/`.
- Canonical URLs are consistent and normalized (prevents index.html duplication issues).
- Hreflang is emitted in the HTML head for all locales plus `x-default`.

### Content architecture
- “Money pages” (commercial intent): Features, Alternatives, Integrations.
- “Support pages” (informational intent): Guides hub + guide articles.
- Internal linking: nav/footer includes Guides; key feature pages link into relevant guide articles and guides link back to money pages.

### Sitemap
- Sitemap is generated by script and includes all locale URLs.
- Each URL includes `<xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="…">` alternates.
- Priorities are tuned: home highest, features high, guides high.

### Structured data
- Sitewide JSON-LD graph (Organization/WebSite/WebPage/BreadcrumbList).
- FAQPage schema is generated for pages that have `faq.q1/a1` style keys.
- No fake ratings/reviews are emitted.

### Build & validation
- `npm run prebuild` generates localized pages + sitemap.
- `npm run build` completes TypeScript + Vite production build.

## How to run

### Local dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Generate localized pages + sitemap
```bash
npm run prebuild
```

### Production build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Google Search Console (GSC) playbook

### 1) Add the correct property
- Recommended: Domain property for `flickai.net` (covers all subpaths/locales).

### 2) Submit sitemaps
- Submit: `https://flickai.net/sitemap.xml`
- After a deploy, re-check the sitemap fetch status in GSC.

### 3) Indexing priorities (first 48 hours)
Use URL Inspection → “Request indexing” for the pages most likely to convert:
- `/` (home)
- `/features/offline-expense-tracker.html`
- `/features/receipt-to-excel.html`
- `/features/scan-receipts-for-taxes.html`
- `/alternatives/` hub and the top alternatives pages
- `/guides/index.html` + the best-performing guide article

Tip: Don’t request indexing for every locale/page in one burst. Start with English + 1–2 priority locales, then expand after you see clean indexing.

### 4) Watch these GSC reports weekly
- Pages → Indexing status (Excluded / Crawled - currently not indexed)
- Sitemaps → success + discovered URLs count
- Enhancements → FAQ (if present)
- Performance → queries/pages/countries, CTR, avg position

### 5) Fix patterns, not one-offs
If you see issues:
- Duplicate without user-selected canonical → usually inconsistent canonical URLs.
- Alternate page with proper canonical tag → usually locale mismatch or hreflang grouping issues.
- Crawled - currently not indexed → improve content depth/internal linking and acquire a few relevant links.

## Backlink + promotion playbook (realistic + safe)

### Positioning angles that earn links
- Privacy-first / offline-first expense tracking
- “Free to start” receipt scanner workflow
- Export-first: CSV/Excel portability (anti-lock-in)

### Targets (high ROI)
- App directories: AlternativeTo, Product Hunt, SaaSHub, etc.
- Finance communities: freelancer/solopreneur blogs, indie maker newsletters, personal finance forums.
- Niche tool roundups: “receipt scanner apps”, “expense tracker for freelancers”, “tax receipt organizer”.

### What to pitch (assets that convert links)
- A short “data portability” explainer (export formats, privacy stance, offline workflow).
- One strong guide that answers an informational query (e.g., “receipt to Excel” or “tax receipts checklist”).
- A simple checklist PDF/printable version of the tax receipts checklist (optional but great for links).

### Outreach checklist (repeatable)
1) Make a list of 30 relevant sites (same-language if targeting a locale).
2) Personalize 1 paragraph: why your guide is better/clearer.
3) Offer a specific URL (guide) and a 1-sentence snippet they can quote.
4) Track: sent / replied / link added.

## Ongoing cadence

### Weekly (30 minutes)
- Check GSC indexing + performance deltas.
- Add 1 internal link improvement: from a money page → guide, and from that guide → money page.
- Publish 1 small improvement to a guide (FAQ, examples, screenshots).

### Monthly (1–2 hours)
- Add 1 new guide targeting a specific query.
- Add 1 new alternatives page targeting a “X alternatives” query.
- Acquire 3–5 relevant links (directories + small blogs). 

## Next content expansions (recommended)
- More guides: “how to track expenses offline while traveling”, “expense categories for freelancers”, “VAT receipt checklist”.
- Integrations pages (by tool): Notion, Google Sheets, Zapier (each as its own landing page).
- Country/locale-specific pages only after the English cluster is solid and indexed cleanly.
