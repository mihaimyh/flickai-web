# Cleanup Plan for Astro Migration

## Overview
This document lists files and directories that can be safely removed after the Astro migration is complete.

## Files/Directories to Remove

### 1. Old HTML Files (Root Directory)
These were generated by the old Handlebars build system and are no longer needed since Astro generates all pages:
- `index.html` (root)
- `accessibility.html`
- `cookie-policy.html`
- `faq.html`
- `gdpr-compliance.html`
- `privacy-policy.html`
- `terms-of-service.html`
- `alternatives/` directory (all HTML files)
- `features/` directory (all HTML files)
- `guides/` directory (all HTML files)
- `integrations/` directory (all HTML files)
- `use-cases/` directory (all HTML files)

### 2. Language-Specific HTML Directories
All language directories in root (these contain old Handlebars-generated HTML):
- `ar/` directory
- `de/` directory
- `es/` directory
- `fr/` directory
- `hi/` directory
- `id/` directory
- `it/` directory
- `ro/` directory
- `zh/` directory

### 3. Old Build Scripts and Configuration
- `vite.config.js` (no longer needed - Astro handles Vite internally)
- Old Handlebars build scripts (if any exist in `scripts/`)

### 4. Old Templates (Keep for Reference Initially)
- `src/templates/` directory - Contains old Handlebars templates
  - **Note**: Consider keeping these temporarily for reference, but they can be removed once migration is verified complete

### 5. Dependencies (Optional Cleanup)
These can be removed from `package.json` if no longer needed:
- `handlebars` - Only needed for old build system
- `glob` - May have been used for old build scripts
- `autoprefixer` - May not be needed if Tailwind handles this
- `postcss` - May not be needed if Tailwind handles this

**Important**: Before removing dependencies, verify they're not used elsewhere.

## Files to Keep

### Essential Files
- All files in `src/` (Astro source code)
- All files in `public/` (static assets)
- `astro.config.mjs` (Astro configuration)
- `package.json` (with updated dependencies)
- `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript configuration)
- `tailwind.config.js` (if exists, or Tailwind config)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (CI/CD)

## Cleanup Steps

1. **Backup** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Pre-cleanup backup before removing old HTML files"
   ```

2. **Remove old HTML files**:
   ```bash
   # Remove root HTML files
   rm -rf alternatives/ features/ guides/ integrations/ use-cases/
   rm -f *.html
   
   # Remove language directories
   rm -rf ar/ de/ es/ fr/ hi/ id/ it/ ro/ zh/
   ```

3. **Remove old build config**:
   ```bash
   rm vite.config.js  # If exists and not needed
   ```

4. **Clean up dependencies** (after verification):
   ```bash
   npm uninstall handlebars glob autoprefixer postcss
   ```

5. **Verify build still works**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## Post-Cleanup Verification

After cleanup, verify:
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] All pages generate correctly in `dist/`
- [ ] No broken links or missing assets
- [ ] All 285+ pages are generated
- [ ] Sitemap includes all pages
- [ ] SEO metadata is correct on all pages

## Notes

- Old HTML files won't affect Astro builds since Astro builds to `dist/`
- Deployment uses `dist/` directory, so old root files won't be deployed
- Keep `src/templates/` temporarily for reference during verification phase
- Old translation files in `public/locales/` have been moved to `src/locales/` and can be removed from `public/` after verification
